# The best kind of storage for the Redis swap file (that's accessed at random) 
# is a Solid State Disk (SSD).

# *** WARNING *** if you are using a shared hosting the default of putting
# the swap file under /tmp is not secure. Create a dir with access granted
# only to Redis user and configure Redis to create the swap file there.
